NDependMetricsTrendCharts
=========================

C# tool for drawing NDepend metrics trend charts using NDepend API

Select a your NDepend project file and navigate through the Assemplies, Namespaces, Types and Methods list.
Checking/Unchecking the metrics at the list on the right will show/hide columns.
You can sort the lists by clicking on the columns headers.  

Double-click on any metric at the list on the right to see the trend graph in a new window.
The graph will run from the first to the last analysis result in the NDepend project's history.
If the code element was only present in some analysis results then gaps will appear.
This way you can see, i.e., if a particular type or method has recently been added to the source code.

Hope you will like the NDepend API usage example ;)
